								Framework for validation suite
								==============================

Directory names within the validation directory tree are used to
associate the enclosed validation tests with the corresponding parts of
cscNetLib.

Description of test run.
-----------------------

*	Any files or directories in the top level validation directory tree
	recursively matching any of the patterns "csc_temp_*", "Csc_temp_*",
	"csc_testOut_*.txt", or "csc_testFails_*.txt",  will be recursively
	removed.

*	During a testing run the top level testing script searches for
	directories by the name "Csc_valDir".  This directory contains a set
	of tests that validate part of the library.  The validation script
	looks for directories with this name, and then does the following:-

	*	If a file by the name of "makefile" is found in this directory (not
		recursively), then "make tests" will be invoked.

	*	If a file by the name of "csc_testRun.sh" is found in this
		directory (not recursively), then it will be invoked.

	*	Any files in this directory or its subdirectories recursively
		matching the pattern "csc_testOut.txt" will be concatenated
		into the main file for the test output.

	*	Any files in this directory or its subdirectories recursively
		matching the pattern "csc_testFails.txt" will be concatenated
		into the main file for the test failures if it contains non-empty
		lines.
